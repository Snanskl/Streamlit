# Streamlit
<br>

this repository showcase my ongoing side project where I practice using the Streamlit library alongside Pandas and Python. The data is sourced from **AdventureWorks2019**. I've connected the 'sqlStreamlit.py' file to my engine server, allowing direct server connections. This setup ensures that any updates in the database are automatically reflected in the Streamlit application. 
<br>

Currently, the Streamlit dashboard displays data from the **'Production.Products'** and **'Sale.SalesOrderHeader'** tables. I have cleaned up several columns to enhance the dashboard's clarity and functionality
<br>

Stay tuned for the upcoming deployment of this project as a web application hosted on Streamlit.
